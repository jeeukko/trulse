# Trulse

Is it true? Is it false? Who knows? Who cares?

Trulse in an JavaScript function which returns true half of the time and false on the other half. Or at least in theory. It's not cryptosafe. Should it? Who knows? Do I care? No.


## Getting Started

First install Node.js and NPM and blah blah blah you know the drill.

```
npm install trulse
```

Then you can use it. Output it to the console or make it deside invesments. I don't care...

```js
const trulse = require("trulse");

console.log(trulse());
```

Or you can make a pull request. I don't care.
